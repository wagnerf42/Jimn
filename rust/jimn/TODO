bentley ottmann:

    - debug polygon builder example

    - check if some y rounding is unneeded (like in intersections and again in add events)
    - remove all overlapping code from bentley ottmann

    - lots of 'move' in closures in Arc. do they inccur overhead ? are they really needed ?

    - treap memory cleaning (we need weak references)
    - we need to be resilient to overlapping segments
        -> write some examples + tests (partly done)


general:

    - check if we can replace some is_some with if let
    - check where to use array map (point ?)
    - can we replace hashmap's entries with [] ?
