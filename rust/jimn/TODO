bentley ottmann:

    - treap memory cleaning
    - we need to be resilient to overlapping segments
        -> 0) write some examples + tests (partly done)
        -> 1) change keys by appending segments's id at their ends (DONE)
        -> 2) serialize insertions/removals by sorting (by angles) + looping
        -> 3) next_intersection_with() instead of intersection_with() (DONE)

    operation 2 is optional if we do not care about obtaining intersections on overlapping
    segments

general:

    - check if we can replace some is_some with if let
    - check where to use array map (point ?)
    - can we replace hashmap's entries with [] ?
