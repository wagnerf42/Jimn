bentley ottmann:

    move paths out of keygenerator and into cutter
    this way we can maybe remove the refcell
    avoid re-comparing points in new_from

    overlap : 

        two targets:
            1) we want to create intersection points and split on overlap points
               * one version like the old code
               * one version removes SOME overlapping parts (only on one side)
            2) we want to destroy all overlapping parts
               * one version extends current code by having some post-operations
               * one version where segments are pre-removed 

    --------> in fine we need three different versions
     a) no overlap anywhere but two different pre-processing
     b) overlap and postprocess to remove
     c) overlap and just be resistant to it (almost current code)



    - we might create points in the present

    - lots of 'move' in closures in Arc. do they inccur overhead ? are they really needed ?

    - treap memory cleaning (we need weak references)

    - it might be possible to create rounding problems:
        consider two consecutive lines (hashed differently) with two almost vertical
        segments intersecting on line 2
        could the x coordinates of intersections with line 1 be equal ?


general:

    - check if we can replace some is_some with if let
    - check where to use array map (point ?)
    - can we replace hashmap's entries with [] ?
