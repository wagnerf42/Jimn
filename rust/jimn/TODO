bentley ottmann:

    - remove all overlapping code from bentley ottmann
    - lots of 'move' in closures in Arc. do they inccur overhead ? are they really needed ?
    - we might create points in the present

    - treap memory cleaning (we need weak references)

    - it might be possible to create rounding problems:
        consider two consecutive lines (hashed differently) with two almost vertical
        segments intersecting on line 2
        could the x coordinates of intersections with line 1 be equal ?


general:

    - check if we can replace some is_some with if let
    - check where to use array map (point ?)
    - can we replace hashmap's entries with [] ?
