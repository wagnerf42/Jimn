bug in arcs envelope
change dualposition constructor

- offsetter still hash precision problems.
we need to design special tests and think again
(problems arise when holes and outer edge are at distance < diameter)

-----> simplify jimn.segment.remove_overlap_with

- warning in poly builder if two paths leaving a point have an extremely small angle between them
- check that we decompress the branch after the whole path for
the branch has been created
- check we can remove arcs from envelope
- validate does not work anymore

 * large goals

- re-think meaning of border : what do we NEED to mill ? what CAN we mill ?
	-> maybe in relation with second pass

 * code review

- more tests are needed for polygon simplification
especially testing flat subparts

 * minor code improvements (readability)
 * minor code improvements (performance)
 * additional non-regression tests
 * misc

- path compression
- generate paths to have more compression feasible
- hardware : better machines : faster on milling axis used :-)

 * calibration

- what precision should be chosen in stl to round z coordinates ?

 * bug fixes

- there is a bug in pocket inclusion
-> will not work in following case :

  +--------------+
  |              |
  +--**------+   |
     **      |   |
     **      |   |
  +--**------+   |
  |              |
  +--------------+

 here all points of * are inside the other one
 yet * is not included in other
 -> either fix it or ensures this case can not happen
