bug: cordoba-large 0.05 0.05 -> l'envelope en l'inner est fausse

change dualposition constructor

- optim: remove many pockets immediately in pocket builder by specifying paths
which will destroy pockets containing them

- offsetter still hash precision problems.
we need to design special tests and think again
(problems arise when holes and outer edge are at distance < diameter)

-----> simplify jimn.segment.remove_overlap_with

- warning in poly builder if two paths leaving a point have an extremely small angle between them
- check that we decompress the branch after the whole path for
the branch has been created ---> impossible without re-cutting cycle at other start point
- check we can remove arcs from envelope
- validate does not work anymore

 * large goals

- re-think meaning of border : what do we NEED to mill ? what CAN we mill ?
	-> maybe in relation with second pass

 * code review

- more tests are needed for polygon simplification
especially testing flat subparts

 * minor code improvements (readability)
 * minor code improvements (performance)
 * additional non-regression tests
 * misc

- path compression
- generate paths to have more compression feasible
- hardware : better machines : faster on milling axis used :-)

 * calibration

- what precision should be chosen in stl to round z coordinates ?
