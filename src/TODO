 * large goals

- polygon offsetting (fred)
- path computation for holed polygon

 * code review

- polygontree.depth_first()
- polygontree.breadth_first()
- polygontree.display_depth_first()
- polygontree.display_breadth_first()

 * minor code improvements (readability)

- inclusion_tree_builder is rather complex : clarify a bit more
- move ascend_polygons from builder into tree

 * minor code improvements (performance)

 * additional non-regression tests

 * misc

- profiling
- test ascii stl loader

 * calibration

- what precision should be chosen in stl to round z coordinates ?
