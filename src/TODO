 * large goals

- change the end of the offseter
- use translated nodes in replacement of translated polygons
- apply offseting to polygon tree and rebuild tree in place
- compute global path

 * code review
 * minor code improvements (readability)

- document new segment merger

 * minor code improvements (performance)

- use arrays instead of hash tables in bellman ford

 * additional non-regression tests
 * misc

- better bounding box for arcs
- profiling
- test ascii stl loader
- rounders in arc class
- is_above_y : arcs ???
- elementary_path : is_same : what about arcs ?? is it needed ?

 * calibration

- what precision should be chosen in stl to round z coordinates ?
