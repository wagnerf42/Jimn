change basic sweeping line algorithm
	-> customize comparison function in treap
		--> add class attribute containing comp operator
	-> register comp function in sweeping_line algo when creating heap
	-> debug kuhn munkres
	-> store results in kuhn munkres
	-> TODO: directly cut here instead of cutting afterward ?
	-> rewrite inclusion tree
remove segment and arc comparison
remove polygonsegment comparison

cordoba: 0.3 0.1 -> overlap of milled areas

segment: merge all intersections code together
-> we need conditional to switch between the different algorithms
-> error analysis

rethink __str__ with strings (returning lines before join) -> good indent

- optim: remove many pockets immediately in pocket builder by specifying paths
which will destroy pockets containing them

- offsetter still has precision problems.
we need to design special tests and think again
(problems arise when holes and outer edge are at distance < diameter)

- warning in poly builder if two paths leaving a point have an extremely small angle between them
- check we can remove arcs from envelope
- validate does not work anymore

 * large goals

- re-think meaning of border : what do we NEED to mill ? what CAN we mill ?
	-> maybe in relation with second pass

- path compression
- generate paths to have more compression feasible
- hardware : better machines : faster on milling axis used :-)

 * calibration

- what precision should be chosen in stl to round z coordinates ?
