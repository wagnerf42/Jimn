 * large goals

- polygon offsetting (fred)
- path computation for holed polygon

 * code review

 * minor code improvements (readability)

- python iterators for tree traversal : depth and breadth first (pierre)
- add point method in bounding box (fred)
- inclusion_tree_builder is rather complex : clarify a bit more
- move ascend_polygons from builder into tree

 * minor code improvements (performance)

 * additional non-regression tests

 * misc

- profiling
