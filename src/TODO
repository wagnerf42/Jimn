 * large goals

- use new caching functions
- do path merging algorithm
  -> we need to store two points in path_positions

- use translated nodes in replacement of translated polygons

 * code review
 * minor code improvements (readability)

- rethink reversed arcs
- document new segment merger

 * minor code improvements (performance)

- special graph even_degrees algo for monotone polygons
- or c binding for bellman ford
- sweeping line algo for last_intersection_with

 * additional non-regression tests
 * misc

- better bounding box for arcs
- profiling
- test ascii stl loader
- rounders in arc class
- is_above_y : arcs ???
- elementary_path : is_same : what about arcs ?? is it needed ?
- path compression
- generate paths to have more compression feasible
- hardware : better machines : faster on milling axis used :-)

 * calibration

- what precision should be chosen in stl to round z coordinates ?
- what to do with rounder when creating arcs ???
- area_limit in poly builder

 * doc

- rapport : inclusion tree

 * bug fixes

- there is a bug in pocket inclusion
- rounding bug in arc creation (see interactive_tests/test_inflate.py)
