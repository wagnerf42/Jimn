-----> move things out of segment and into elementary_path (comparison ?)
-----> simplify jimn.segment.remove_overlap_with

- warning in poly builder if two paths leaving a point have an extremely small angle between them
- better docs for new pocket builder
- check if vertical intersections are still needed in arcs
- avoid creating reversed arcs : change offsetter to avoid them directly
- remove read only accessors
- check that we decompress the branch after the whole path for
the branch has been created
- check we can remove arcs from envelope
- fix again arcs orientation in offsetter

 * large goals

- jimn.tree.polygon_tree.is_translation_of

- reorganize hashed points : only hash min number of points required

- re-think precision problems :
	when 3 points are almost aligned, offseting using parallel segments
	creates two segments separated with a very small arc
	-> for now this should not happen due to polygons remove_useless_points
	but is it really safe ?

- re-think meaning of border : what do we NEED to mill ? what CAN we mill ?
	-> maybe in relation with second pass

 * code review

- more tests are needed for polygon simplification
especially testing flat subparts

 * minor code improvements (readability)

- rethink reversed arcs
- document new segment merger
- tidy vertical segments

 * minor code improvements (performance)
 * additional non-regression tests
 * misc

- profiling
- test ascii stl loader
- is_above_y : arcs ???
- elementary_path : is_same : what about arcs ?? is it needed ?
- path compression
- generate paths to have more compression feasible
- hardware : better machines : faster on milling axis used :-)

 * calibration

- what precision should be chosen in stl to round z coordinates ?
- area_limit in poly builder

 * doc

- rapport : inclusion tree

 * bug fixes

- edges in both directions are displayed twice

- there is a bug in pocket inclusion
-> will not work in following case :

  +--------------+
  |              |
  +--**------+   |
     **      |   |
     **      |   |
  +--**------+   |
  |              |
  +--------------+

 here all points of * are inside the other one
 yet * is not included in other
 -> either fix it or ensures this case can not happen
