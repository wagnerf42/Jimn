 * large goals

- replace simple jimn.graph.make_degrees_even by something smarter
add length to arcs
- polygon offsetting (fred)

----> we need to handle overlapping segments and arcs after raw offseting (split and or remove)
	and before paths selection
-> segment merger need to be modified in order to support un-ordered segments

 * code review
 * minor code improvements (readability)

- in graphs : the mix between points and vertices is at the same time nice and troublesome

 * minor code improvements (performance)

- use arrays instead of hash tables in bellman ford

 * additional non-regression tests
 * misc

- better bounding box for arcs
- profiling
- test ascii stl loader
- rounders in arc class
- is_above_y : arcs ???
- elementary_path : is_same : what about arcs ?? is it needed ?

 * calibration

- what precision should be chosen in stl to round z coordinates ?
- what to do with rounder when creating arcs ???
- area_limit in poly builder

 * doc

- rapport : inclusion tree
