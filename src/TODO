 * large goals

- polygon offsetting (fred)

----> we need to handle overlapping segments and arcs after raw offseting (split and or remove)
	and before paths selection

 * code review
 * minor code improvements (readability)

 * minor code improvements (performance)

 * additional non-regression tests
 * misc

- better bounding box for arcs
- profiling
- test ascii stl loader
- rounders in arc class
- is_above_y : arcs ???
- elementary_path : is_same : what about arcs ?? is it needed ?
- interactive_tests/test_graph.py : why have top vertices such a high degree ?

 * calibration

- what precision should be chosen in stl to round z coordinates ?
- what to do with rounder when creating arcs ???
- area_limit in poly builder

 * doc

- rapport : inclusion tree
