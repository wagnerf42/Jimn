 * large goals

- polygon offsetting (fred)

----> there is a bug right now for comparing arcs (is_above)
      vertical_intersection_at in jimn.elementary_path is only ok for segments but not for arcs
	-> move vertical_intersection_at out of elementary_path and into both segments and arcs classes

----> we need to handle overlapping segments and arcs after raw offseting (split and or remove)
	and before paths selection

- path computation for holed polygon

 * code review
 * minor code improvements (readability)

- remove duplicated code (checking for contains) in arc by moving it upwards in elementary segment

 * minor code improvements (performance)

 * additional non-regression tests
 * misc

- better bounding box for arcs
- profiling
- test ascii stl loader

 * calibration

- what precision should be chosen in stl to round z coordinates ?
- what to do with rounder when creating arcs ???

 * doc

- rapport : inclusion tree
